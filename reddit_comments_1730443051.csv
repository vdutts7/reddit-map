"I never really had much of a horse in either race, though I didn't like Romney at all and any chance McCain had of getting my vote evaporated when they put a lunatic like Palin on his ticket.

I like Obama as a person, though.  I've really enjoyed having a President that genuinely seems to enjoy science and technology and nerdy pursuits, and we've had some really amazing photographs come out of the White House when he's around kids.

The past 8 years we've seen him angry, we've seen him sad, and we've seen him goofing off with kids, but no matter what he always looks like a president.

"Republican here.  I never voted for Obama but applaud him for two things: sensible foreign policy and (as politicians go) being honest.  Thank God he kept us out of Syria and other unnecessary wars.  I disagree with virtually all of his domestic policies but he promoted them in good faith and what he thought was in the country's best interests.  He spent eight years in the White House and despite the best effort of his political enemies, he was never impugned with any serious political controversy.  The most significant taint of dishonesty during his administration was from Hillary Clinton-- which shows you how terrible a candidate she is and how much of a decent man he was.

On the off chance that you read this, there are a few things I have to say.

As I have become more politically aware, my appreciation for all of the things you have done, and rights you have secured has grown. Thanks to you, not only America has recovered from the Bush dynasty, but my critical thinking skills are very well developed. Regardless on people's stance on your policies, there is no denying that you did *your* best, and have been an extraordinarily wise, charismatic, and thoughtful president.

Definitely the most 'Canadian' out of all the presidents I've known, and from what limited understanding I have of his accomplishments, I've always felt he took the country in a truly forward direction. Obamacare was a mess I've been told, but holy fuck the fact that America still doesn't have have public healthcare is pathetic. He was level-headed, smart, funny, charismatic and, most importantly, didn't do moronic shit like deny climate change (really though, how much of a fucking neanderthal do you have to be to deny climate change).  
With Obama and Trudeau, I really enjoyed the direction North America (sans Mexico) was heading in, sad to see that Americans still haven't truly understood the necessity of having a more liberal leader. Anyways, Obama in my books will be my numbah 1 president, but I doubt we'll see anything like him for a while.

"The worst part is that we will never know what could have been, in the three branches of government he had little support to do anything, and that's not such a bad thing. When the wheels of government turn slowly it typically results in an uneventful Presidentsy and that was the case with Obama relatively peaceful relatively prosperous. We can only wonder, what may have changed or been accomplished had he had more of a mandate.

Now, along comes Trump and with him a possible surprising mandate with control of two, if not all three branches. An arguably radical agenda and possibly the support to implement it. Again, the United States of America has possibly elected a ""Republican"" President and given him the keys to the kingdom.

This election is very reminiscent of 2000. It's strange, 16 years is a long time but the older I get the shorter it seems, but to many voters it's half or most of their lives. I'm not sure what I'm trying to articulate, Trump is not Bush, but he could be similar. It certainly seems that the next four years will not be as tepid as the prior four  and this election is similar to 2000s. It's surprising to me how short the memory of the US electorate is and how quickly it forgets the past and drastically changes into something different but a reincarnation of the past. Let's hope that Trump can do something similar with manufacturing and the economy, while restraining himself and his mandate to not repeat the mistakes of the past.",[deleted],2,0,1478666980.0

My favorite Obama moment has to be when, during a victory speech (I think after the passage of the ACA), Joe Biden made a harsh quip at the Republicans' expense and Obama reached out, touched Biden's elbow, and gave Biden a very slight frown and head shake.

"I think Obama was a very likable President, but I'm not sure if he was a good one.  The wage gap between the poor and rich widened more, he had one of the least transparent administrations especially after running on being transparent, and race relations seemed to get vastly worse.  Obamacare seems to be a good step forward, but I feel like the health care companies are going to be the biggest beneficiaries of the system.  I know he got stonewalled in Congress a lot so I don't think it's fair to blame him for everything, but I feel like he could have done more.  Just my opinion of course.  I will definitely miss his sense of humor and overall charming demeanor though.  Our new President will definitely be lacking in those areas.",[deleted],1,0,1478656873.0

Rich vs. Poor

"I am a moderate, I think that both Hillary and Trump are complete shit. REGARDLESS of all of that, I will say that Obama did not have any positive impact on the country. He was mainly neutral. I will say that the biggest impact he had was from Obamacare. The price to pay for Obamacare was insane. Unfortunately it was lower than the big corporation I was working for, but only the monthly bill was lower. They Didn't cover shit when I had issues or went to the hospital. I can't think of one thing that Obama would be remembered for going forward. I am glad you all can get your angst out and upvote this pic, but Seriously?!?!?

"All the Hillary voters have been lied to and brainwashed by the mainstream media! They have been deluded by the carefully orchestrated, false narrative, and the lies to the point that they were sure Hillary would win - meanwhile being totally unaware of the revolution that was taking place in the USA. I hope they will wake up to reality: they have been lied to!

Though I have always identified as a left leaning, liberal democrat, I have become totally disgusted with the leftist, false narrative and the smear campaign against Trump. It was very, very off-putting, disingenuous, dishonest and sleazy! I am actually glad Trump won! Let's hope he can help us take the country back out of the claws of the owners of the country. This small group of rich assholes own the press, the media, the banks and the politicians. I call upon my fellow democrats to embrace this opportunity and unite against the establishment that has been pushing for the wars and destruction!Ôªø

Even if you don't like Trump, there is an opportunity! Trump wants to build up and modernize the infrastructure, because the USA is falling apart and is in many ways like a 3rd world country! You don't have to go out with him, you don't have to date him, you don't have to like him, but he is the only candidate that might give us a chance to break free of the stranglehold and sinister agenda of the owners of the country. Trump is like penicillin: nobody likes it, but it is necessary to remedy a problem. ",boomtao,0,0,1478690975.0

3) Obama borrowed $10 TRILLION with nothing to show for it.

4) 50% of college graduates cannot find a full-time job in their field of study.

5) Obama is the only president in history that for the first 7.5 years of his presidency the median income fell.

6) Record numbers of people on Food Stamps and Welfare.

8) Highest percent of unemployed 6 months or more since the Great Depression.

9) Obamacare is failing and collapsing at an alarming rate, 20 million people got insured while 200 million people's premiums skyrocketed.

10) That promise of racial unity that Obama was supposed to represent has turned into our country having the worst racial relations in decades. We have cities from Baltimore to Charlotte literally burning down in race riots.",[deleted],-17,0,1478655763.0

We don't have Medicare for all, we actually got the healthcare plan Mitt Romney was proposing. And after all that on his way out Obama shat on Bernie Saunders during the primary by helping the DNC lobby for Hillary to make sure America maintains the status quo and his corporate buddies and donors can keep getting paid.

>At the direction of U.S. President Barack Obama, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was put in charge of the operations, worth about $1 billion annually, to arm anti-government forces in Syria,[101][102][103][104] an operation which began in 2013, more than two years after the start of the civil war in 2011. Prior to 2013, the CIA only supplied the apparently moderate rebels of the Free Syrian Army with non-lethal aid, but later began providing training, cash, and intelligence to selected rebel commanders.

A billion dollars a year in training and materiel, [US airstrikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American-led_intervention_in_Syria#Airstrikes_on_the_Khorasan_Group), special forces on the ground, massive civilian casualties and a huge refugee crisis, all sparked by the US - and that's Obama ""keeping us out of Syria""?",lodbible,1,1,1478726727.0

"1. Passed Health Care Reform: After five presidents over a century failed to create universal health insurance, signed the Affordable Care Act (2010). It will cover 32 million uninsured Americans beginning in 2014 and mandates a suite of experimental measures to cut health care cost growth, the number one cause of America‚Äôs long-term fiscal problems.

2. Passed the Stimulus: Signed $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 to spur economic growth amid greatest recession since the Great Depression. Weeks after stimulus went into effect, unemployment claims began to subside. Twelve months later, the private sector began producing more jobs than it was losing, and it has continued to do so for twenty-three straight months, creating a total of nearly 3.7 million new private-sector jobs.

3. Passed Wall Street Reform: Signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010) to re-regulate the financial sector after its practices caused the Great Recession. The new law tightens capital requirements on large banks and other financial institutions, requires derivatives to be sold on clearinghouses and exchanges, mandates that large banks provide ‚Äúliving wills‚Äù to avoid chaotic bankruptcies, limits their ability to trade with customers‚Äô money for their own profit, and creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (now headed by Richard Cordray) to crack down on abusive lending products and companies.

4. Ended the War in Iraq: Ordered all U.S. military forces out of the country. Last troops left on December 18, 2011.

5. Began Drawdown of War in Afghanistan: From a peak of 101,000 troops in June 2011, U.S. forces are now down to 91,000, with 23,000 slated to leave by the end of summer 2012. According to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, the combat mission there will be over by next year.

6. Eliminated Osama bin laden: In 2011, ordered special forces raid of secret compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in which the terrorist leader was killed and a trove of al-Qaeda documents was discovered.

7. Turned Around U.S. Auto Industry: In 2009, injected $62 billion in federal money (on top of $13.4 billion in loans from the Bush administration) into ailing GM and Chrysler in return for equity stakes and agreements for massive restructuring. Since bottoming out in 2009, the auto industry has added more than 100,000 jobs. In 2011, the Big Three automakers all gained market share for the first time in two decades. The government expects to lose $16 billion of its investment, less if the price of the GM stock it still owns increases.

8. Recapitalized Banks: In the midst of financial crisis, approved controversial Treasury Department plan to lure private capital into the country‚Äôs largest banks via ‚Äústress tests‚Äù of their balance sheets and a public-private fund to buy their ‚Äútoxic‚Äù assets. Got banks back on their feet at essentially zero cost to the government.

9. Repealed ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell‚Äù: Ended 1990s-era restriction and formalized new policy allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military for the first time.

10. Toppled Moammar Gaddafi: In March 2011, joined a coalition of European and Arab governments in military action, including air power and naval blockade, against Gaddafi regime to defend Libyan civilians and support rebel troops. Gaddafi‚Äôs forty-two-year rule ended when the dictator was overthrown and killed by rebels on October 20, 2011. No American lives were lost.

11. Told Mubarak to Go: On February 1, 2011, publicly called on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to accept reform or step down, thus weakening the dictator‚Äôs position and putting America on the right side of the Arab Spring. Mubarak ended thirty-year rule when overthrown on February 11.

12. Reversed Bush Torture Policies: Two days after taking office, nullified Bush-era rulings that had allowed detainees in U.S. custody to undergo certain ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù interrogation techniques considered inhumane under the Geneva Conventions. Also released the secret Bush legal rulings supporting the use of these techniques.

13. Improved America‚Äôs Image Abroad: With new policies, diplomacy, and rhetoric, reversed a sharp decline in world opinion toward the U.S. (and the corresponding loss of ‚Äúsoft power‚Äù) during the Bush years. From 2008 to 2011, favorable opinion toward the United States rose in ten of fifteen countries surveyed by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, with an average increase of 26 percent.

14. Kicked Banks Out of Federal Student Loan Program, Expanded Pell Grant Spending: As part of the 2010 health care reform bill, signed measure ending the wasteful decades-old practice of subsidizing banks to provide college loans. Starting July 2010 all students began getting their federal student loans directly from the federal government. Treasury will save $67 billion over ten years, $36 billion of which will go to expanding Pell Grants to lower-income students.

15. Created Race to the Top: With funds from stimulus, started $4.35 billion program of competitive grants to encourage and reward states for education reform.

16. Boosted Fuel Efficiency Standards: Released new fuel efficiency standards in 2011 that will nearly double the fuel economy for cars and trucks by 2025.

17. Coordinated International Response to Financial Crisis: To keep world economy out of recession in 2009 and 2010, helped secure from G-20 nations more than $500 billion for the IMF to provide lines of credit and other support to emerging market countries, which kept them liquid and avoided crises with their currencies.

18. Passed Mini Stimuli: To help families hurt by the recession and spur the economy as stimulus spending declined, signed series of measures (July 22, 2010; December 17, 2010; December 23, 2011) to extend unemployment insurance and cut payroll taxes.

19. Began Asia ‚ÄúPivot‚Äù: In 2011, reoriented American military and diplomatic priorities and focus from the Middle East and Europe to the Asian-Pacific region. Executed multipronged strategy of positively engaging China while reasserting U.S. leadership in the region by increasing American military presence and crafting new commercial, diplomatic, and military alliances with neighboring countries made uncomfortable by recent Chinese behavior.

20. Increased Support for Veterans: With so many soldiers coming home from Iraq and Iran with serious physical and mental health problems, yet facing long waits for services, increased 2010 Department of Veterans Affairs budget by 16 percent and 2011 budget by 10 percent. Also signed new GI bill offering $78 billion in tuition assistance over a decade, and provided multiple tax credits to encourage businesses to hire veterans.

21. Tightened Sanctions on Iran: In effort to deter Iran‚Äôs nuclear program, signed Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act (2010) to punish firms and individuals who aid Iran‚Äôs petroleum sector. In late 2011 and early 2012, coordinated with other major Western powers to impose sanctions aimed at Iran‚Äôs banks and with Japan, South Korea, and China to shift their oil purchases away from Iran.

22. Created Conditions to Begin Closing Dirtiest Power Plants: New EPA restrictions on mercury and toxic pollution, issued in December 2011, likely to lead to the closing of between sixty-eight and 231 of the nation‚Äôs oldest and dirtiest coal-fired power plants. Estimated cost to utilities: at least $11 billion by 2016. Estimated health benefits: $59 billion to $140 billion. Will also significantly reduce carbon emissions and, with other regulations, comprises what‚Äôs been called Obama‚Äôs ‚Äústealth climate policy.‚Äù

23. Passed Credit Card Reforms: Signed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act (2009), which prohibits credit card companies from raising rates without advance notification, mandates a grace period on interest rate increases, and strictly limits overdraft and other fees.

I have some really big problems with the warhawk interventionism, the TPP, the killing of Al-Awlaki. Generally, most of his foreign policy decisions. 

Even some of his policies domestically with NSA meta-data, whistle blowers, DEA marijuana policy.

Even for the things I disagree with him on, I can respect the fact that he was a constitutional professor. 

Hes always laid out the arguments in a sound way, to the point where its. I don't agree with his decisions, but I at least get a reasonable answer to why he came to it. 

I really think thats the best you'll get as far as Presidents go. You can disagree, even vehemently, but a reasonable explanation I can live with.

As much as people want to say, Obama didn't start from the bottom. He was born into politics.
Did not go through with what he wanted to do.
Is a deadbeat politician
Made America worse in debt and unemployment.
Countries are not afraid to threaten him

One day to vote. You can cast your vote early too by mailing it in and a few other ways but most of it is today. The new elect takes office in Jan I think. Obama is still the president till Jan but has no power. Election process is kinda tough to explain. Basically 51 elections take place across the country in each state and DC. Each state has electoral college votes which go to whichever candidate wins a particular state. 270 votes needed to win Presidency. ,[deleted],2,1,1478671222.0

Obama is nothing but what you said - talk. His Hope was bullshit. His Change was for the worse. He got the Nobel Peace Prize and started ramping up drone strikes on unconfirmed targets in civilian locations immediately after. He executed US citizens without trial. He created ISIS through incompetence. He allowed domestic surveillance the likes of which only China can compare to. He allowed illegal immigration to skyrocket, fucking over the many good people following the proper immigration routes in favor of criminals with no respect for our laws who don't contribute to taxes.

Normalizing drone assassinations happened because people allowed themselves to overlook it because of all the feel good oration. It SHOULD be scary when a president sets a new precident on warfare and killings. It's not supposed to feel okay, because it's not an okay thing.

I'm so glad trump is in the seat for this peiroid of history because now well get to see what an ass-fucking sans lube really feels like. The buisness of global hegemony is dark and dirty and we should be as raw-nerved toward it as we can. The CIAs slow undermining of target nations (helping SA spread wahhabisim, funding destabalization) is dark dark business, and Trump is the first president since Kennedy who's taken a position against that institution's processes.

Overlooking US support for funneling ISIS under Obama because we got (the inevitable) gay marriage rights passed is exactly the kind of sleepy ""it feels so good, he's so presidential"" bullshit that we need to do with out for a good while. And then be smart enough to not jump on the dick of the next Obama because we want in from the cold and think another smooth talker will save us.

"ISIS formed back in 1999 and grew following the disbanding of the Iraqi army and the mass imprisonment of many innocent ""military aged males"" by the US troops following the Iraq invasion - by the time Obama took the reigns there was literally nothing to be done that would have peacefully ended the sectarian civil war there.  Never mind the conflict in Syria, even if that had never happened Iraq would still have had violence in the Sunni areas that ISIS eventually steamrolled into, cause the Bush-appointed Malaki government was a fucking disaster.  

And how was Obama in any way involved in regime change in Syria?  He repeatedly pushed against many of his advisors (including Clinton) who wanted to intervene on behalf of the FSA in the early months of the conflict, but Obama said no for two good reasons - Russia and Iran have geopolitical interests at stake and starting a proxy war with them would be stupid, and that the rebels were made up of dozens/hundreds of groups who couldn't be vetted with any degree of certainty, so we shouldn't risk letting arms end up in the wrong hands.

"""Successful stimulus"" are you joking? 

The national debt has increased under obama, is that another joke? The debt is up 2 trillion on his presidency.

Job growth in manufacturing? Obama damaged the job market, more people have to take part time work instead of full time because of obamas health care law.

he doubled clean energy?? I remember solendra and the failures of obamas first 4 years, he could not stimulate the clean energy market no matter how hard he tried. Most of the innovations have come from the free market. 

Tripled the stock market? O, and how much did that help you? 


Obamas real legacy is the greatest gun and insurance salesmen in US history. He didn't do any of the reforms he promised in 2007, the war on drug rages on mass incarceration continues with it, the war on terror has expanded, our debt increases at a higher rate, more journalists are under attack by this administration. Great example he set about how to go after the media, now
Fucking trump is prez he will push that boundary further than obama did, but instead of reform Barack just did whatever the Deep state wanted.

"I find it highly worrisome you'll jump to Obama's defense without knowing *any* of his administration's scandals. A short list:

Half a billion dollars invested in Solyndra only for that company to go bankrupt, Operation Fast and Furious enabling the transfer of firearms to known criminals and then the ATF losing track of those guns, relatedly Eric Holder (Obama's AG) was held in contempt of Congress for not testifying about it, whatever your opinions on it the Affordable Care Act was filled with scandal ranging from ""if you like your plan you can keep it"" to Congress voting not to allow themselves to be subject to the ACA to multiple rewrites and changes to the actual law that made it almost impossible to keep to track of, the actual failure of the ACA website at launch requiring almost another billion dollars more than had been claimed necessary, what was promised to be the most transparent administration in history has been the least transparent with more whistleblowers prosecuted than any other administration in history and even going so far as to spy on Associated Press reporters, relatedly the IRS giving special scrutiny to conservative groups like the Tea Party and pro-life groups which included delaying tax-exempt applications until after the 2012 election, and the Obama justice department declined to prosecute anyone even after multiple hard drives containing IRS data pertinent to this scandal ""failed"" and were immediately shredded and Lois Lerner took the Fifth during Congressional hearings on the scandal, the Obama Administration traded multiple Taliban prisoners for Bowe Bergdahl who is now on trial for desertion and treason, the Iran nuclear deal and the pallet of money sent to Iran as payment and totally not as ransom money, the EPA caused a hazardous waste spill in the Colorado River that eventually led the state of Colorado to declare a state of emergency, the VA was discovered to be intentionally putting veterans on long wait lists for medical care sometimes years long, and numerous coverups of the above scandals. There are more - including some debatable ones and some that verge on conspiracy theory - but these are objective scandals that anyone with a political motivation would be hard-pressed to defend with anything resembling reason.

Frankly, I find it pretty horrific you'd compare any of these scandals to anything Donald Trump has been accused of without evidence. The IRS scandal alone should have devastated this administration when the IRS admits wrongdoing, Lois Lerner takes the Fifth for her role in it, and archives of potential evidence are wiped off the face of the earth and Eric Holder - himself having been held in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify - refuses to prosecute on the behalf of the Obama Administration.",proquo,17,3,1492272934.0

He launched a drone program which has killed hundreds and hundreds of innocent people, often based on flimsy meta data!

He created new powers that allow authorities to detain Americans without trial.

He didn't accomplish any of his promises regarding the middle eastern conflicts, or shutting down extra-judicial prisons or treatment of 
prisoners - including torture.

He made it impossible to sue Monsanto

He Promised not to employ lobbyists in his administration and subsequently filled his administration with lobbyists.

He provided weapons to drug cartels in south America.

He supported a tax funded bailout for the very same financial institutions that were responsible for it in the first place.

So it's not that Obama never said stupid stuff. It's that I saw more non-stupid stuff with Obama than I recall seeing with other politicians.

It's easy to say China relations went sour. Beijing is trying to annex the entire South China Sea which would be a geopolitical gamechanger in favor of Beijing. Do you favor Obama letting China do what they want? Because if not, then what he's been doing is exactly what he should be doing.

Russia is about to have a demographic and economic crisis which has led Putin to be very aggressive. And if you want to see what an ""all time low"" is for US-Russia relations, have a look at what happened in October 1962. Or just any year during the Cold War.

Middle East is not being run by Iran. We basically told Iran to stop building nuclear weapons and they gave in. In 100 years, if Iran never gets a nuclear weapon, we can look back at Obama's presidency as the time when tensions between the two countries simmered down.

When leaving they now have a very good underwriting data set for these new customers and basically costed out the higher risk back to the plans.    The net effect is that because the plans were setup to be fragile by the states and without any long term commitments they basically guaranteed that the insurance providers would cherry pick low risk/profitable consumers out of the state plans and leave the high cost consumers concentrated in the plans as they thin out.

"Companies drive their employees hard because competition. As a result, employees don't have time to take care of themselves. However, here, have some heavily subsidized health insurance. This was decades ago. Some places even offered free full benefit health plans. Companies use their bargaining power with middlemen (insurance) to get relatively affordable rates and often could subsidize the full cost. Hospitals say, hmm, this might be a good way to shift some unfunded hospital costs around. Well, let's not be too greedy, but let's use some actuaries to figure out costs for each procedure and pad in some healthy buffer and we can use this as a starting point to negotiate contracts with insurance companies. Let's call this a charge master and generally not publicize this to customers because they can't really understand what these costs mean. They won't need to anyway. If somebody comes in without insurance, we'll just send them on to the public hospitals...  
  
Decades later, the population is fattening up from all those long hours and quick processed carbs, in general their health situations are declining. The bad off are really bad off, chronic condition on top of chronic condition and the acute attacks and stabilization resulting cost tons of money. Re-admissions through the roof. Hospitals start dumping (transferring at a glance) poor, uninsured patients into publicly funded hospitals. In comes the federal government: NO! EMTALA private and semiprivate hospitals! You can no longer dump, you have to stabilize any ER patient that comes through your doors regardless of insurance status. And once you stabilize you often have to provide acute care that results from the ER visit anyway. States and cities see an opening and begin massively under-funding public hospitals and they start to close (huh, who would've thinked it?). As a result, uninsured people begin using the ER to get access to free healthcare. Additionally, since Medicare caps reimbursements and states begin closing down public hospitals the burden of underfunded care shifts to private health systems as well.    
  
Partially as a result of this, and many other factors, bad feedback loops arise: hospitals don't know what to do except to begin putting quotas on doctors and unnecessary procedures shoot up. Insurance companies take notice and begin implementing medical necessity/utilization management and any procedure that isn't evidence based care route documented gets denied. Hospitals don't know what to do except padding their procedure costs. Insurance companies increase the denial rates, hospitals continue padding on procedure costs. Charge masters get out of hand. $5000 to set a broken finger. $2600 for an MRI. Etc. Etc.
  
Meanwhile, insurance companies are bargaining harder with large employers because they don't have near enough healthy people in their insurance pools anymore, and they don't have enough employees probably to deny everything they can without violating contracts (and the public and Congress would frown on that). Large companies are noticing their employee health insurance outlays every year going up and start settling for less and less generous plans with higher deductibles, or asking employees to pay more and more of their premiums.  
  
Also, hospitals contract out for more of their services now, so on top of the hospital visit (for facilities) there is also a professional fee (profee) on top from the doctor, or the organization representing them.  
  
Result, even if you are employed $500 a month for a pretty terrible $3000 deductible plan. If you don't have a job, you pay out the nose for limited options per ACA neutered by Congress. People give fake names at ER, or if they don't they just laugh when the hospital tries to charge them $10000 for their recent visit. Heck, if you friend is an Aussie citizen if he laughs long (but not that long) enough, the hospital will probably just end up writing it off.  
  
TLDR: Bottom line, large players subsidizing the cost of care for some, poor visibility into the real cost/charge for service, poor understanding of the various players involved in just a single exam room and their affiliations and rates, unfunded federal mandate requiring ER care resulting in free care and underfunded care/write offs to the hospital bottom line, defunding public health institutions until collapse (public /= nonprofit which can be multi billion dollar org), how we live as a result of no work life balance, not to mention at all the name brand drug/patent issues (which is a much smaller piece of the problem)...",zenfish,2,3,1478661246.0

He pissed *everybody* of at one time or another.

"Great, we actually have a very similar educational background. I'm going to quickly address the non-China points since I want to get to the fun stuff.
1) If you have to compare Russian relations to the 1960s, then relations are fucking bad. I appreciate your interest in clarifying that the Cold War was worse than it is now but you've proven my point. Russian geopolitics are also spiraling out of control because

2) Iran is acting as a regional power in the middle east. Iran and Russia are supporting Assad's regime in Syria and have effectively kept coalition forces out. They've called bullshit on every single 'red line' the US has come up with and Kerry lost face with the chem weapons debacle. I would imagine that a 'no-fly red line' would be broken in a day or two. I also urge you to read up on Qasem Soleimani and how Iran filled the post-Saddam power vacuum. The Iran nuclear deal was done too hastily and we've already seen Iran continue developing nuclear weapons. The US had incredible leverage against Iran which was crippled under intense economic sanctions. Instead, the terms gave everything to Iran with few assurances by the US. The US could have least asked for some soft-power concessions like the release of hostages. Would have been better than dumping off crates of dollars and euros. 

3) I look forward to seeing what happens with Cuba. I hope Miami takes it back. It isn't apparent what the US gets out of this other than another vacation spot for the rich and famous. Some of my Cuban friends don't get their visas and the older ones don't want to see their families' homes turned into Air BnBs. Pure anecdote but its what I've seen. Maybe the DOC or the State Department got something sweet out of the deal but I haven't seen it. 


China! First, lets talk about the TPP. One purpose of the TPP is to be the economic 'fuck you' towards China and the 'pivot towards Asia.' If Obama could've gotten the TPP passed then I would give more credit in his pivot but all we've seen now are military posturing. And how well has that posturing gone? Best thing to happen out of this was the PCA deciding that the islands didn't belong to China. The US has definitely kept China from taking everything immediately but we've only put our finger in the dike. I believe the TPP will inevitably be passed in some form, we are due for a new RTA. China recognizes this, which is why they suggested RCEP as a counter (but RCEP is a joke). That isn't to say that CFIUS and our solar industry don't do a good job keeping Chinese investors out. CFIUS I understand but the solar investment was a debacle. Obama's administration pushed for many more students learning Chinese and Chinese policy. Those initiatives, including the 100K strong, were essentially supplied teachers from the Confucius institute, a propaganda wing of the Chinese government. Oh, then there's the cyber issue the US is facing. Russia got popped for this email disaster but it could just have well been China. I think Hillary chose Russia as the email bogeyman because she knows how delicate US Sino relations are. The US president can't even get a damn set of stairs off his plane over there. I've lived in China and I've seen my fair share of buhaoyisi and meibanfa but that was a deliberate rattling of Obama and his entourage. Also, why the hell weren't they traveling with a translator from the US? On a lighter topic, let's talk about how Obama snubbed Xi on his tour to the USA. Especially how he sat Xi next to Mark fucking Zuckerberg and forced him to to listen to Mark's kindergarten Chinese all night. Let's not forget that Zuckerberg asked Xi to name his freakin unborn child. 

China has been going through some serious internal reorganization. I don't know how old you are but maybe you remember what it was like in 2012. Maybe you remember Chongqing and the massive anti-corruption campaigns that still carry on today. Maybe you remember that shift after Hu and have a clearer perspective on how China is moving backwards, not forwards. But China can afford to centralize, even against a world economy. Look at the recent cases of Apple, Disney, and several banks trying to operate in China. They have effective WTO carve outs and they're winning disputes. China is also the lender of choice in developing nations and developing ties in places the west simply doesnt give a rats ass about.

I give a lot of credit to the guys and girls in the State Department. Managing this shit is tough and is the likely culprit for not a small sum of grey hairs on BO's head. However, I gauge the effectiveness of foreign policy based on success, not difficulty, so you can imagine my disbelief when people try to pass BO off as some sort of Foreign Policy guru.

If the guy who hits me doesn't have car insurance, mine covers what they can for me. I have car insurance because I drive significantly more than I see the doctor. Also, not having it is illegal, unlike not having health insurance. It's also a **LOT** cheaper.

"Man, the Jedi are evil. 

They claim to be ambassadors but they don't bring any sort of order. They do a lot of diplomacy with an army that they don't have. They tell the republic to move in a direction where they really have no stake in the game. They kidnap kids to put into their education program to teach them how to more or less, ""persuade,"" people to doing things that they want. They preach peace, but they are EXTREMELY hands-off ish. They have the ability to maybe save lives and resurrect people but they say, ""Noooo that's the dark side?"" How much medical progress are they holding that they just won't give to the rest of us?

Sure, maybe the force powers do weird shit to your skin. And maybe they were a little bit, ""in your face,"" about getting what they wanted. But  they took responsibility for their actions.

"Oh I wasn't concerned with your stance on or generalization of ACA. To be clear, I don't love the policy I'm not a fan of how it passed or when it passed, and nobody in my family nor myself is even remotely a beneficiary of ACA policies. 

My concern is how people parade around simplistic ideas like ""just [needing] to fix costs and state boundaries"" like they know what they're saying and then patting themselves on their backs about how they could totally fixed a trillion dollar industry that's corrupt (guess which party pharma and insurance lobbies are in bed with) and that lives depend upon. 
 
The intention of regulation isn't to ""fuck people in the ass."" The intention of regulating insurance companies in such a way that provides MORE people with coverage can't possibly be construed as such, unless you're an insurance executive; you stated you think everybody should be able to get coverage and, as it happens, more people have coverage now than when it passed. The ""fucking people in the ass"" is a reaction to lower profit margins based on less-than-ultra-optimal risk pooling with the influx of newly insured, likely sick, people (read: people that didn't use to have health insurance and now do, like OP's brother). Now insurance companies actually have to provide insurance and pay for healthcare instead of just collecting premiums on perfectly healthy people. Again, the profits aren't lost, they're just smaller. If you're not making more money, you're losing money, right? So let's raise premiums on everybody then so that we're making as much as we use to. 

But you can't blame insurance companies for looking at it that way. They have their employees to take care of, fat bonuses to pay to execs, congresspeople to wine and dine, and their longevity, market share, general livelihood etc. to consider. Their role in negotiating costs with providers can't be overstated, and, ultimately, they are the means through which healthcare can be made affordable, so it doesn't make sense to totally demonize them. Is all of this an ACA problem? Or an insurance company problem? Probably a little bit of both. Would we be better off without ACA? I think a lot of people, like OP's brother, would say ""no,"" even though I know people like me pay for to insurance companies for it. 

That's just the private insurance part of the bill, we're not even talking about the medicare and medicaid expansions, penalties, etc.. I would have hoped that a person that's willing to state a strong opinion would at least recognize the value of a nuanced one that accurately represents the issues at hand. If your only talking points on ACA consist of hyperbole and saying how fucked it is, then you'll permit me my misgivings on your ability to intelligently discuss healthcare policy.

"Not only did not everyone's premiums go up, but in fact healthcare premiums slowed in [2015](http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/analysis-of-2015-premium-changes-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/) and **reduced** in [2016](http://kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/analysis-of-2016-premium-changes-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/).
""For a 40 year old making $30,000 per year, the average change after tax credits would be -0.2%"" (down 10% from 2015). The weighted change in costs for healthcare premiums is **-0.7%**

The affordable care act works. Triage systems like the one I personally enjoy in Canada work. And it may be worth noting that Americans already pay **more** in taxes per capita to cover healthcare costs than we do in Canada. The only difference is that Americans get no healthcare in return for that investment. The quality of care is the same. So why do Americans pay so much? Well let's look at the big spenders...

The following are American healthcare costs that are higher than should be expected given America's economy, etc. (per year):

 * $75 billion - Salaries for doctors and nurses
 * $90 billion - Insurance/administrative/marketing/negotiations
 * $100 billion - Drugs
 * $500 billion - General care (in-patient and out)

Part of the problem is that America actually doesn't negotiate very well with healthcare providers, drug manufacturers, etc., so due to inelastic demand, healthcare costs have been allowed to climb to where they are today... If you need a pill to not die, you're probably going to be willing to pay a lot for that pill. And in America, some of the people who make those pills are willing to use that demand to make more profit. Capitalistic greed is a bitch. The solution to the problem is systematic overhaul, and the affordable care act was a good step in that direction. Socialized health insurance works well everywhere else...",Vaysym,8,5,1490153501.0

"Why the hell is the ""ass to kick"" comment an example of his lack of uniting? He was talking about the BP oil spill, and his consulting experts to know who was responsible. 

I honestly think your reading of Obama runs counter to the vast majority of interviews and profiles I've seen of him. Look through anyone's speeches and you'll find mistaken pieces that are regretted (especially politicians, who have to comment on *everything*). You've picked out 3 examples from 8 years. You've had more than that from Trump in the transitional period even before he's taken office. And Obama has apologised, which is more than Trump has ever done, aside from that vague, non-specific attempt during campaigning.

Since George Bush Snr went out, the Republican party has been way more partisan and divisive/uncompromising than the Democrats have been, and the fact is that Obama's been trying to unite whenever he can, but he's had limited options since he's been facing a congress that has had Republicans blocking him outright at every turn on point of principle [because he is involved](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/07/08/why-president-obama-cant-bring-us-together/?utm_term=.29bbec30e294) and refusing compromise (esp. Tea Party candidates). Though I'm never a fan of exclusive executive power, he's had little option as he's facing people who just put their fingers in their ears rather than working together to create a compromise.  

Finally - of course he mocked Trump on the campaign trail. What were you expecting to happen? The guy is a pisspoor candidate who's been flinging conspiracy theories over Obama throughout his presidency. He only got on the ballot and won because people are so desperate for any change they would've taken a shaved monkey who didn't throw his shit at people (well, maybe if it was labelled as not being politically correct). What did Obama do when it was all over? Was professional and curteous and is doing his best to respect the vote and unite the country rather than continue the campaigning, however much he disagreed with it. ",DeyTukUrJrbs,2,5,1482545377.0

Many ""red"" states decided to opt out, in what was likely an attempt to finally protect the middle class and/or to retaliate against Obamacare (I'm not making this partisan so I'm not saying why the state congress members voted). This has been cited as a reason for the nation-wide rise in health care costs by many Republicans. Many Democrats believe that if the states had accepted the subsidies, the private insurance companies would have been better able to cope with a massive increase in patients. ",FameGameUSA,7,5,1478656896.0
Part of Obama care was that states would expand Medicaid to help cover people making middle incomes cover the cost of healthcare. The Feds would pay 90% of the increase the states would pay 10% of the cost. So in democratic states that expanded Medicaid the people their get subsidies to pay their healthcare but the republican governors said fuck you to all that free money to fuck their own citizens into hating Obamacare.,Demshil4higher,5,5,1478656868.0

"Lol please explain how healthcare is/was ""capitalist"" when government is involved at every stage and every level, front to back, top to bottom. If, that is, by ""capitalist"" you are using Marx's derogatory term for free enterprise. Because there is not nor has there been for a long time anything resembling free enterprise in healthcare.

However, there are certain health-related services that have so far largely escaped the government behemoth, like dental or chiropracty. These are far closer to free enterprise in the lack of massive government oversight and control. And as a result they are usually far more pleasant and inexpensive than other medical services. Even major dental surgery(which is skull surgery, not an insignificant thing) is a tiny fraction of the cost of even a minor hospital surgery. But I'm sure this has nothing to do with the amount of government regulation in these professions, right? Cos' not.

With ACA we added another huge helping of government to our healthcare system, over the protests of roughly %70 of the country, to assurances that this would get rising healthcare costs under control and make everything much more fair. Fail.

>He launched a drone program which has killed hundreds and hundreds of innocent people, often based on flimsy meta data!

> He created new powers that allow authorities to detain Americans without trial.

This one is a half truth. He did create new powers. Beyond that though, the powers largely existed already, again under the patriot act passed by the Bush administration.

Which is the next thing that he says:

>He not only continued with the Patriot Act, he expanded it!

But he acts like it's a new fact. Again, Trump is showing no signs of acting differently in this regard. Instead he's expanding DHS's ability to harass citizens further. 

> He created new powers that allow authorities to detain Americans without trial.

Repeating himself. One thing I will say about this repetition however is that electing Hilary clinton wouldn't have changed any of this. So props to the Republican party for at least trying something different this time around, even if it is pretty clear that it still isn't changing. 

>He didn't accomplish any of his promises regarding the middle eastern conflicts, or shutting down extra-judicial prisons or treatment of prisoners - including torture.

Tacitly false. It wasn't a great choice, but he did cause a large scale down of both conflicts from when he took office. 

> He made it impossible to sue Monsanto

That was the legislative branch, not Obama. 

> He provided weapons to drug cartels in south America.

Definitely the worst thing Obama did during his tenure. I won't try to defend this one. It was bad.

> He supported a tax funded bailout for the very same financial institutions that were responsible for it in the first place.

Nope, once again memories are short. He bailed out the Auto makers, but they weren't responsible for the financial crisis. TARP, which is what this guy was referencing was passed under Bush.

I'll agree with you however that the guy isn't a shill. He's just an idiot.

When they came up with the ACA, it was a good idea, but they didn't put enough, much less any, restrictions on the insurance companies. They said they had to accept anyone. What they forgot to add was that the insurance companies had to accept, but they could put any rate they wanted on it, basically saying that we could buy it or face the penalty of not having health insurance, thereby eliminating just about anyone on an independent plan and only keeping businesses or those willing to pay the big money.

"I think I get your point. If I understand what you're saying correctly, it's like you walk into a crowd of street performers in Central Park. As you walk through the large congregation of mediocrity, you see a wonderful artist that just grabs your attention for a moment. Then, as you walk up to give him money to show your praise, a man jumps in front of you, out of no where, and grabs the money from your hand while saying, ""Thanks! I'll let him know you liked it!"" You can't be sure, but you think you saw him wearing a shirt that said, ""New York Central Park Authority"". 

If that's not accurate please tell me so, I'm not trying to mock you. I promise.

I do, however, disagree. It's different in that Central Park is a public place and taken care of through tax dollars provided by NYC residents. It would instead be like going to a private building where they have different rooms set up. You aren't required to pay anything to get in and see the performers. Also, when you walk in, you are given a few magnets you can stick one-per-person someone's name tag or you can take one of those same magnets away from anyone but if you make a small donation of a million dollars you can get an approval token. 

As you walk around, on most days, you don't notice anyone, anywhere, talking about anything all that interesting. Then, one day, while walking around after having not paid, you hear an amazing statement from someone. It made you double over in laughter. So, instead of letting that person, who (for the sake of this metaphor) couldn't hear you, go on thinking they weren't enjoyed. You go back up to the box office and pay your small donation of a million dollars, come back to the speaker, and give him the token you just received.

Now you are happy, the speaker is happy, and the venue is happy. You were entertained, the speaker was lauded, and the venue can now continue to maintain a free environment for others to enjoy.

At least that's my own personal feeling on the matter. I would never try and force my opinion on anyone. Even if their opinion is wrong, ya know, like yours is. :D (kidding)

Edit: After thinking about the Central Park scenario, I think it should be. ""You see performers with men and women standing in front of them. All wearing ""Central Park Authority"" shirts. While watching a performer you really like, you say, ""I really like that!"" After which, you notice one of the men in a ""Central Park"" shirt turns to the performer you were watching and give them a thumbs up. Standing there a moment longer you say, 'Man, I *really* like this!"" yet they do not turn around and give a thumbs up this time. So, you decide to give them a few dollars instead. As you go to hand the performer money, that same guy with the shirt takes it. While you stand there in shock, you turn to him and watch him place the money in his pocket. After a second, he turns around to the performer once again, but this time he doesn't give them a thumbs up, he gives them two!",Snote85,1,7,1478666118.0

"The requirements were that you expand Medicaid.

Medicaid money is paid to providers by the individual states, but the federal government reimburses a percentage of the money depending on the income level of the state, with richer states getting a lower reimbursement rate and poorer states getting a higher reimbursement rate.  There are minimum benefits/coverage that states have to meet in order to get that money from the feds, but states are free to set their coverage/benefits above the minimum level, and some do.

The ACA included a provision that if states were to increase Medicaid coverage, the additional population would be reimbursed at like 80-90% for the first few years.

So there's two ways that you can look at it.  Realistically, states turned down a few years of free money for their residents who would have trouble affording premiums on the exchanges but would now qualify for Medicaid coverage instead.  But in doing so, the GOP could showcase their moral purity in denying the dirty federal money, and hogtie the ACA to build a case for its removal, which you can see them doing in this election cycle.

Some states might have worried about the financial burden after the higher reimbursement rate went down to normal.  But I doubt that, because that's fairly long-term planning, and you're still missing out on millions of dollars while the reimbursement rates are high.",[deleted],16,7,1478657028.0

Congress voted on that ""huge war"" albeit with false info which we must assume the president also believed as correct. The president is not responsible for nor is he capable of controlling anxiety levels in children. 

If the children are having disorders then the parents are to blame.

The corporate agenda is easier to implement since the bills they want to pass have been written up already by lobbyists. The liberal agenda requires months of research and careful deliberation. Things looked really bleak in 2014. However they have brightened up given how much Bernie has been able to sway the party in to adopting a liberal agenda.

i came from literally now where. i have no connections. i put myself through school, THEN i worked lower levels in my field. im about to transfer to upper management next week.

this opportunity is all over the US.

that is unfortunate, but that is how life goes. same thing happened to the milkman. careers become obsolete. i picked a career that had staying power. i made sure my career didnt have any challenges to it. personal responsibility.


that said, your man did make that choice to go into that field (so there goes that part of what you said). and now he has the choice to diversify. train up in something new. this stuff happens all the time. i know an ex special forces guy who works on computers now.


>If this mans only realistic choice is to wait for his old job, does he really have a choice? I don't believe that he does.

see above. not only could he get different training, but he can also switch careers.

is there some law that states they cant move? 

so here is the thing; life is full of tough decisions. the left wants its cake and to it eat too. it wants the ideal. the right, on the other hand, understanda that choices have consequences.

"I honestly think that the welder's best option for getting a new job is to lie about how he spent the last ten years. But that sounds like it's probably illegal and a poor way to start working relationships. I would be surprised if a mechanics shop hadn't been one of the first ten places he applied to.  There is a lot of welding to be done on cars, especially on custom exhausts and such. 

I'm not sure how much 'due' was afforded Rod at the landscaping job after I left, but I would wager that it was very little. When I joined he had already been working for some time, all the other guys and I just kinda assumed that he was acting supervisor when the actual boss man left to do whatever it was he did all day. Yet the first thing I was given on my first day was a key to the shop. Trusted to open and close at 8 and 5. At the time it was a big ego boost, but I've since wondered if it was only because I was the only white kid working for him.

did they literally not save any money?

did they waste it on nonsense? yes it means they fucked up. my current employ has allowed me to save 20,000 in reserve, and i was lower enlisted US Army. then i ranked up, but thats neither here nor there.

i put myself through college too. if im fired, i can fall back.

well you are unable to get past your indoctrination. how about this; lets say you were poor even though you were a doctor. would you simply keep treating people who could not pay... or would you look elsewhere so you can feed your own family? 

you are now flabbergasted ar yourself, unless you would literally just let yourself and your family die that is... admirable? sure, but i sure as hell eouldnt do it

>Everything I've ever learned points to the idea that there is an unjustified amount of luck involved in having hard work really pay off. 


im going to gloat; im easily one of if not the hardest worker in my complex. 
the reason i say this is that yes, ive been passed over before and it pisses me off too.

that said, i still have moved quickly through promotions even if i miss other cool opportunities (my fellows got reeeally cool schools, and yes that makes me jealous). 

but one of the reasons i am where i am, is not simply because i work hard. i also stand up for myself. a few of my co workers (when we were still peers), got all the schools, and awards. i took this higher, with just the right amount of assertiveness, made my case, and i got awarded my current position and i got another award a long with it.

sometimes you just got to ball up, and not leave it to simply being noticed

"I understand that there is a very active part that one has to play in order to be noticed, but I am very afraid that is a part that I may well be unable to play. I'm not sure how I come across in text, but in person I come across very poorly in so small part because I am autistic. I really don't want that excuse to be a crutch for me but its really hard not to let it. 

For example, I'm going to welding school right now and most of what we do is run a particular bead and show the resulting weld to the instructor for advice on what went wrong, right, what should be done instead, or whatever. Early one I decided that it would be a good idea to take a moment to look at my welds myself and try and predict what the instructor would say about it so that in the future I would be able to more easily self correct my mistakes. That neat idea has backfired on me as of late, because it twisted into an excuse to have a pity party in my welding booth for half an hour like a total fucking bitch. And the core of my problem so stupid too. I'm afraid of interrupting the instructor. He not even doing anything. He's just siting on the table waiting for someone to approach him and I can't do it. I have to wait for someone else to show him their stuff, because then it wasn't me who interrupted him. It's so dumb and it doesn't make sense and it only gets worse when he's actual doing something or I'm the only student still in the lab because everyone else didn't waste any of their time hiding in their booth. 

Even when I know my work is good, I feel shamed because I know that I could of done it better. Nothing short of perfection has ever given me pride, and my vision of perfection can not be made with human hands. How am I supposed to make a case that my work is good or that I deserve more? I can't bring my self to believe that I'm worthy of what little I already have.

I've believed for a long time that the most I could do was to try my best and to let my work speak for me. God knows I cant speak for myself.",davidp1522,5,1,1488476838.0

Yes, those may not be something YOU agree with, but nevertheless, they **ARE* accomplishments.  It's okay for you to have an opinion.  But to avoid reality and bend the truth, c'mon buddy.

If you're unhappy about Obama dealings with Iran, then...you have to be pretty pissed off about how much Trump **and his handlers** has been in bed with Russia, right?  Or let me guess, you're in denial of the NUMEROUS pieces of evidence that come into the light on a weekly basis.  I know, I know...EVERYTHING is FAKE NEWS, right?  Better yet, ask yourself how would you feel if it was Obama and his handlers that had all these ties to Russia.  How would you feel?  Would it still be fake news if it was being reported?

At the end of the day, you're a Trump supporter.  That's cool.  Someone has to support the guy.  I don't support the guy.  All that smoke, there's a fire somewhere.
